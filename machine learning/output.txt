Reading Ronaldo: contingent whiteness in the football media. Article in Soccer and Society · November 2015 DOI: 10.1080/14660970.2014.963310 CITATIONS READS 41 1,524 2 authors: Kevin Hylton Stefan Lawrence Leeds Beckett University.
Cristiano Ronaldo Dos Santos Aveiro is a Portuguese professional footballer, better known simply as Cristiano Ronaldo, Ronaldo and sometimes just by his initials and shirt number CR7. Ronaldo currently plays for Real Madrid C. F. in Spain’s Primera División. He became the most expensive footballer in the sport's history after leaving Manchester United FC to join the Spanish club in a deal reported to be worth ca. £80 million.
The dangers associated with ignoring media representations and audience interpretations of Ronaldo’s identity are that the white athletic body contin- ues to be perceived as aracial. Through an exploration of contingent whiteness, this process con- tributes to the distortion of white male supremacy, and illuminates the racialized aspects of the white male athletic body.
We explore how the privileges of whiteness can emerge in how individuals and groups are depicted in the media. We explore some of the ways in which privilege is manifest and contested through media representations and how audiences interpret media imagery. While it is important to understand white privilege, and how it oper- ates in sporting contexts, any consideration of white privilege must also consider the notion of white supremacy.
We point to the dismissal of comments made by ex-Arsenal and England footballer, Sol Campbell, as a pertinent example of white supremacist systems in operation in football. Campbell suggested that he had been white he would have been England captain ‘for a decade or more’ The failure of English football’s elite to investigate these claims therefore, not only denies and invalidates Campbell's racial- ized experience of football, but highlights how people, systems, policies or cul- tures can subjugate racialized individuals.
Whiteness is not homogenous but fractured by the myriad ethnic practices of Russian Jews, Poles, Italians or Irish people. Whiteness has been shown to be divided by other social factors such as class, sexuality and gender. We embrace the notion of contingent whiteness for its deconstructive potential.
Inherent to Nayak’s understanding of ‘race’, racial identity and racialized pro- cesses is the notion of performativity. In simple terms, performativity is the perpet- ual repetition, reproduction and re-enactment of dominant discourses. This is not a simple allusion to skin colour; rather, it is a reference to a way of conducting, acting, dressing, speaking, being and living with and through a racialized body.
This paper emerged from a larger study exploring the racialized aspects of media representations of athletic bodies from three British men’s magazines. The magazines were selected to interrogate how their representa- tions were interpreted by white men. Using a triptych of images from the original study, we explore an aspect of the study that considered how whiteness was attributed and denied as it intersected with masculinity.
Sport magazine has published three images of Cristiano Ronaldo in the UK. The first and largest image of Ronaldo is one in which he is pictured jumping into the air, with one arm aloft, sideways on to the camera, celebrating a goal. The second image shows Ronaldo exposing a naked, tensed, muscular upper- body. Finally, the third image is one of a more restrained Ronaldo, in a sports car, complete with sunglasses.
Ronaldo’s perceived willingness to perform heteromasculinity in such a manner is unbecomingofdominantimaginingsofnormative,heterosexual(white)Britishmascu- linities. Once again, it is not our intent to cast a moral judgement on Ronaldo or his off-field behaviour but to comment on the disparities that exist.
Interviewees were asked about Ronaldo’s ethnic identity/whiteness/ Otherness. Participants often engaged in this process so as to articulate a racialized politics of belonging. The responses of participants imply, to greater or lesser degrees, that Ronaldo should either be placed in an ‘other’ category or be classified as white.
Bradley states Ronaldo ‘doesn’t look … black’ Scott unequivocally makes reference to Ronaldo’s ‘darker skin tone’ as a marker of a racialized embodied Otherness. Future research would be equally advised not to dismiss the notion that ‘race’ continues to be read onto and inscribed into skin.
Sebastian questions the status of football, more broadly, as a proving ground for dominant heteromasculinities. He is particularly keen to draw attention to Italian men’s football as a culture harbouring a natural sporting ethos he understood as strange, bizarre, Other. Participants expressed openly racist, xenophobic and homophobic views which position Ronaldo, and other football players like him, at the peripheries of whiteness and outside dominant, socially acceptable performances of white, heterosexual (Anglo) masculinity.
The readings of Ronaldo enable us to illustrate the contingent nature of whiteness. embodied performances of ‘race’ are not only slippery and contestable, but are continually challenged, inscribed, confirmed and undermined by nationality and regionality. We are critical of reading racism(s) and privilege, and therefore whiteness, from within a black–white paradigm.
The use of whiteness to include/empower and exclude/disem- power in this study is an indicator of this. This assertion is certainly not to be read as a call to ignore the needs of Black people in football, or sport more broadly. The ambiguous positioning of white people as Other inevitably creates a dilemma for those claiming white racial identities. ‘[t]he enemy is never white’
Cristiano Ronaldo proved to be an enigmatic figure whose representations, read from (white male) British perspectives, evoked numerous and often conflicting com- mentaries, descriptions and interpretations. In sum, the paper reveals the contradictory nature of audience interpretations of Ronaldo and Other white identities. These realities enable us to understand better the complex contin- gent nature of whiteness.

racialized aspects of the white male athletic body. These are a number of issues we explore in the paper. Whiteness is directly linked to a societal position of power that affords those per- ceived as white with invisible privileges unavailable to Othered bodies.5 In this sense, whiteness can be thought of as a form of property or resource.6 A particularly useful analogy of white privilege is provided by Scheurich7 who likens it to walking down the street while money is put in

This article was downloaded on 03 October 2014 by Professor Kevin Hylton and published online by Routledge Informa Ltd in Soccer & Society. It contains discussions, stats, and author profiles for this publication at: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279070953 Reading Ronaldo: contingent whiteness in the football media. 
Kevin Hyltona, Stefan Lawrence and Taylor&Francis discuss the role of Cristiano Ronaldo in the footballing world and the social implications of his on and off-field behaviour. They argue that white British men's interpretations of Ronaldo’s whiteness are inextricably linked to discourses of ‘race’, masculinity and football.
In this paper, the authors explore the complexities of white male identity in relation to Ronaldo. They discuss the theoretical framework, the methods and the critical reading of Ronaldo’s representation in Sport magazine. They also consider the responses of their participants to the images of Ronaldo and their related privileges and assumptions.
White people are beneficiaries of a host of seemingly neutral social arrangements and institutional operations. The privileges of whiteness can emerge in how individuals and groups are depicted in the media. White athletes are privileged to exist as unique athletic bodies propelled to stardom by exceptional circumstances. White supremacy is a political, economic, and cultural system in which white people inhabit networks of power and material resources.
Sol Campbell suggested that if he had been white he would have been England captain for a decade or more. FA officials and their counterparts in mainstream football media dismissed Campbell's claims. They deny that racism or their recruitment and progression could have been a factor in Campbell's comments.
Some theorize whiteness as white domination of, and white discrimination against, non-whites, and especially blacks. Nayak, Satzewich and others argue that whiteness is contingent and interwoven with other social factors such as class, sexuality, and gender.
Nayak uses the concept of performativity to show that race is a performance, a racial discourse and a process of (dis)embodiment. Whiteness is slippery and constantly shifting because it is interpreted differently by a multitude of different people. It is important to understand how racialized performances are important features of white supremacy.
This paper emerged from a larger study exploring the racialized aspects of media representations of athletic bodies from three British men’s magazines. The magazines were selected to interrogate how their representa- tions were interpreted by white men. They interviewed 22 white British men between the ages of 18 and 45. They used a blended ‘interpretative’ and ‘reflexive’ approach to interview analysis.
Sport magazine congratulates Cristiano Ronaldo on his achievements as a footballer and gives him a short interview with him. Sport uses three common images of Ronaldo in the UK to show him as a pictogram of glamour, celebrity, class, arrogance and pretentiousness. Ronaldo crashed his new Ferrari into a tunnel wall.
Ronaldo’s perceived willingness to perform heteromasculinity in such a manner is unbecoming of dominant,heterosexual, white, British men. Sport’ s mockery of Ronaldo serves to locate him as an individual whose lifestyle and behaviours require regulation and critical commentary. Bradley would look at Ronaldo as a white man.
Bradley, Scott, Damian and Jake discuss Ronaldo's ethnic and ethnic identity. They are divided on whether Ronaldo should be placed in an ‘other’ category or be classified as white, but only begrudgingly. The testimonies illustrate the conflation of race and ethnicity.
Bradley states Ronaldo ‘doesn’t look black’ whereas Scott makes reference to Ronaldo’s ‘darker skin tone’ as a marker of a racialized embodied Otherness. The testimonies gathered during this research highlight the difficulties white men have in escaping speaking of culture and ethnicity in racial terms. Paul described the athletes as ‘Poxy Italian footballers’, and Sam labelled them as The Dolce & Gabbana, Italian gay boys.
Sebastian questions the status of football as a proving ground for dominant heteromasculinities. He is particularly keen to draw attention to Italian men’s football. He makes reference to ‘posing’, ‘fashion’ and ‘falling over’ as stereotypical features of Italian men's football.
Ronaldo and the Italian football players were reported to embody different political projects of belonging. The discussions summoned by readings of Ronaldo contest the notion that racism is a practice that ‘whites do to blacks’ This paper advocates a move beyond a simple ‘Black men are powerless and white men are powerful’ paradigm.
According to the study, footballers like Ronaldo are positioned both as (peripherally) white and Other. The study suggests that future explorations of whiteness as problematic is another means towards dismantling the black–white bin- ary.    K. Hylton, S. Lawrence and RosseforP[ yb dedaolnwoD12 are the authors.
Cristiano Ronaldo is both revered and ridiculed as a football player and an enigmatic figure. The paper reveals the contradictory nature of audience interpretations of Ronaldo and Other white identities. It also shows how intersecting racialized and masculine identities are marked and negotiated through football discourses.
